What is a judgment?
What you think should be the case.

What is a decision? 
What action you think you should make out of the options which are available to you.

What are descriptive claims? 
- objective (what is actually factual, truthful, evident).
If I say that the sky is blue, that is a descriptive claim, because the sky is actually blue.

What are normative claims? 
- subjective (your opinion, what you think should be the case).
If I say the sky should be pink, this is a normative claim, it is my opinion of what I think the sky should be.

What is a Cognitive Reflection Test?
- Measures an individual's ability to suppress an initial incorrect answer in favor of a correct reflective one. 
- Three problems designed to elicit wrong answers, forcing responsers to engage a slower, more deliberate 'Type 2' cognitive process to arrive at the right solution.
- Used as evidence for the dual processing theory: that there 2 different cognitive processes

What is evidence that CRT problems generate an 'intuitive' answer?
- incorrect answers dominate 
- people who gave correct answer consider the wrong answer initially
- those who provide incorrect answers thought the problems were easier than the people who provided correct answers.

What is Dual-Processing Theory?
- Theories that cognitive processes (decision and judgment making) cluster into two different types of processes: those which are type 1 and those which are type 2.

What are Type 1 Processes?
- unconscious, automatic, no attention or memory required, not intentional or controllable, associative, heuristics, parallel, domain-specific and high capacity
- such as heuristics

What are Type 2 Processes?
- conscious, manual, require attention and memory, slow, domain-general, low-capacity, intentional, controllable, rule-based, analytic, sequential
- such as using rationality, reasoning, and rules

What are issues which can be posed about dual process theory?
- can't some of the attributes overlap from one process to the other?
- some cognitive processes/thinking use both processes
- how do type 2 processes 'switch on'?

What are parallel-competitive models?
- Type 1 and Type 2 processes are engaged from the start, but type 1 are faster than type 2, so type 1 produces output before type 2 processes.
- if outputs conflict, additional type 2 processing may occur 
example: 

makes sense -> parallel competition means both processes occur at the same time, but it makes sense that type 1 finishes before type 2 as it is faster than type 2.

what are default interventionist (serial) models?
- type 1 engaged from start (not type 2)
- type 1 outputs -> if response is suspect, type 2 processing might occur

What are hybrid models?
- multiple type 1 processes happen at same time, produce conflicting answers
- if they conflict, type 2 is engaged.

What is the cluster problem in dual processing theory?
- that attributes on different sides of the chart might overlap:
  unconscious (T1) and slow (T2): sleeping on a problem
  unconscious (T1) and intentional (T2): skilled activity (speaking, driving)
  uncontrollable (T1) and intentional (T2): bat and ball problem
  unintentional (T1) and controllable (T2): stereotyping, mimicing others

how are heuristics related to dual processing theory?
- heuristics are rule-based (like t2 processes) but they are quick, automatic, unconscious

how can memory be divided?
1: sensory
2: working 
3: long-term -> procedural
             -> declarative -> episodic
                            -> semantic

what is the working-memory model?
1: central executive: attention controller
2: phonological loop: verbal + auditory information
3: visuospatial sketchpad: visual + spatial info
4: episodic buffer: memory store, verbal, auditory, visual, spatial info (sensory)

what is an example of the working memory model? 
students struggling to study / pay attention while listening to music with lyrics, it is better to study listening to music w/o lyrics because visual items (digits) are recoded using subvocalization (phonological loop), lyrics interfere with phonological loops

what are the functions of the central executive?
1: focus attention
2: divide attention
3: switch attention between tasks
4: interface with long-term memory

what is the function of the phonological loop?
1: phonological store: short-term storage for speech + sounds
2: rehearsal process: repetition of sounds transfers into long-term memory

what is visuospatial sketchpad?
- visual info (identifying objects)
- spatial info (locating objects)

what is the episodic buffer?
storage component of central executive: working memory holds long sentences

what is the clustering problem in dual process theory?
- the argument against dual process theory, that they are not truly 2 distinct processes because some of their attributes overlap (some t1 attributes could be allocated to t2 processes and vice versa)



What is the new unconscious?
- individual cannot self-report some cognitive states or processes because they are unconscious (inaccessible)
